</details>
<br>

> üîç **Insight**: The United States overwhelmingly dominates in revenue generation, contributing over $8.8 billion, while the next country, Finland, generates only $5.99 million. This indicates a strong concentration of high-value customers in the U.S. market.


### Query 6Ô∏è‚É£: Top Landing Pages by Pageviews
```sql
SELECT
  hits.page.pagePath AS landing_page,
  COUNT(hits.page.pagePath) AS views

| 10  | /store.html/quickview                                     | 170   |

</details><br>

> üîç **Insight**: 

- The homepage (/home) is the dominant entry point, accounting for the most pageviews (2,212), followed by major product category and shopping flow pages such as /basket.html, /store.html, and /signin.html.
- This pattern suggests that users often begin at the homepage, explore product categories, and proceed into the cart or account-related flows‚Äîhighlighting a typical ecommerce funnel.
- Improving UX and loading speed on these top-visited pages could directly impact engagement and conversion efficiency.

### Query 7Ô∏è‚É£: Browser with Highest Conversion Rate
```sql
SELECT
  device.browser,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(totals.transactions) / COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(fullVisitorId, visitId)), 3) AS conversion_rate
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_20170801`
GROUP BY device.browser
ORDER BY conversion_rate DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
<details>
<summary>Click to expand query result</summary>

| Row | browser  | conversion_rate |
|-----|----------|-----------------|
| 1   | Chrome   | 2.158           |
| 2   | Firefox  | 0.990           |
| 3   | Safari   | 0.756           |
| 4   | Edge     | null            |
| 5   | Coc Coc  | null            |

</details><br>

> üîç **Insight**: 

- Chrome users exhibit the highest conversion rate at 2.16%, significantly outperforming other browsers. Firefox and Safari show moderate performance, while Edge and Coc Coc recorded no measurable conversions.

- This suggests that optimization efforts (UX/UI, compatibility, and speed) should be prioritized for Chrome first‚Äîfollowed by Firefox and Safari‚Äîto maximize conversion potential across the most impactful browser platforms.

### Query 8Ô∏è‚É£: Hourly Transaction Trend
```sql
SELECT
  EXTRACT(HOUR FROM TIMESTAMP_SECONDS(visitStartTime)) AS hour,
  COUNT(totals.transactions) AS transaction_count
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_20170801`
WHERE totals.transactions IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY hour;
```
<details>
<summary>Click to expand query result</summary>

| Hour | Transaction Count |
|------|-------------------|
| 2    | 3                 |

### üìå Dimension-Based Summary

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Traffic Source Effectiveness
- **Direct** traffic generated the most users, sessions, and transactions.

---

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome** users converted more effectively than others.
- Browsers like Edge and Coc Coc had no recorded conversions.

**‚Üí Recommendation**: Prioritize Chrome and Safari UX, while troubleshooting or deprioritizing unsupported browsers.

---
