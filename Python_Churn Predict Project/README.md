# Python Customer Churn Prediction Model

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques in Python, leveraging libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-Learn.

## Project Overview

The goal is to build a predictive model that accurately identifies customers at risk of churning, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## Skills and Tools Used

- **Python**: Implemented the entire data pipeline and modeling process.
- **Pandas**: Managed data cleaning and preprocessing tasks.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Utilized for model building, evaluation, and feature selection.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Acquired customer data from [source].
2. **Data Cleaning**: Addressed missing values and inconsistencies using Pandas.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identified key patterns and relationships influencing churn.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Created new features to enhance model predictive power.
5. **Model Building**: Applied various algorithms using Scikit-Learn, selecting the best-performing model.
6. **Evaluation**: Assessed model accuracy and fine-tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.
7. **Deployment**: [If applicable, describe how the model was deployed or how predictions can be accessed.]

## Key Insights

- Identified primary factors contributing to customer churn.
- Developed actionable recommendations to reduce churn based on model findings.
