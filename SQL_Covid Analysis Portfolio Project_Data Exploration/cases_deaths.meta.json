  "description": "Daily COVID-19 cases and deaths by date reported to WHO.\n\nFrom the 31 December 2019 to the 21 March 2020, WHO collected the numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths through official communications under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005), complemented by monitoring the official ministries of health websites and social media accounts. Since 22 March 2020, global data is compiled through WHO region-specific dashboards, and/or aggregate count data reported to WHO headquarters.\n\nWHO COVID-19 Dashboard is updated every Friday for the period of two weeks prior.\n\nCounts primarily reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based upon WHO case definitions; although some departures may exist due to local adaptations. Counts include both domestic and repatriated cases. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times (e.g. time to case notification, and time to reporting of deaths) differ between countries, territories and areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts presented with variable under or overestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays to reflecting these data at a global level.\n\nAll data represent date of reporting as opposed to date of symptom onset. All data are subject to continuous verification and may change based on retrospective updates to accurately reflect trends, changes in country case definitions and/or reporting practices. Significant data errors detected or reported to WHO may be corrected at more frequent intervals.\n\n**New case and death counts from the Region of the Americas**\nStarting from the week commencing on 11 September 2023, the source of the data from the Region of the Americas was switched to the aggregated national surveillances, received through the COVID-19, Influenza, RSV and Other Respiratory Viruses program in the Americas. Data have been included retrospectively since 31 July 2023.\n\n**Rates**\n<0.001 per 100,000 population may be rounded to 0.",

        "The actual death toll from COVID-19 is likely to be higher than the number of confirmed deaths \u2013 this is due to limited testing, [poorly functioning death registries](#dod:crvs), challenges in determining the cause of death, and disruptions during the pandemic. The difference between reported confirmed deaths and actual deaths varies between countries.",
        "[Excess mortality](https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid) is a more comprehensive measure of the total mortality impact of the pandemic, compared to the number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths. This is because it captures not only confirmed deaths, but also COVID-19 deaths that were not accurately diagnosed.",
        "COVID-19 deaths may be recorded in different ways between countries (e.g., some countries may only count hospital deaths, whilst others also include deaths in homes).",
        "Data are presented by the date of reporting rather than symptom onset, and retrospective updates by countries can sometimes lead to sudden spikes or even negative values.",
        "WHO encourages weekly reporting to reduce inconsistencies in daily reporting frequencies across countries and help minimize the risk of misinterpreting periods of zero reporting as zero deaths.",
        "There are often large differences in the population size between countries. Therefore, to compare deaths between countries, it is more insightful to look at the number of confirmed deaths as a rate per million people.",
        "We provide more detail on these points in [Deaths from COVID-19: background](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths#deaths-from-covid-19-background)."
